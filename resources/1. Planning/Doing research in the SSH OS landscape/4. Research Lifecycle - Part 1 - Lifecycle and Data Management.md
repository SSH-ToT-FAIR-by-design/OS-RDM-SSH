## Description

The first module of the training is an introduction of the Open Science environment to SSH researchers. This module has four learning outcomes.

- Describe the current policy landscape that shapes knowledge production and the way it affects the SSH Research Framework
- Identify SSH practices in Open Science
- Recognise SSH specificities within the research workflow during knowledge production from an ethical, legal and methodological perspective.
- Describe  what the research data management requirements and standards are

In this learning unit we will discuss SSH in the research life cycle and we are going to look at:

- Research life cycle as a concept
- Data life cycle
- ELSI

## Research Lifecycle Frameworks


There are numerous frameworks of research lifecycles with similar key stages like planning, project execution, and dissemination of results, tailored by different institutions in accordance with their operations.

### Research Data Management Lifecycle

Research data garners a lot of attention as it is one of the most crucial components of the research puzzle. Of course analysis and reports, and outcomes are the fundamental to why we do research, but the essence, and the further understanding of how we reach a conclusion or an outcome, should be based on the accumulation of data and research materials during the analysis process.

### Open Science - Specificities of SSH

In the realm of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), there is a significant diversity in what we perceive as data. This diversity extends to multilingualism, acknowledging the necessity to manage and interpret data in multiple languages. Bibliodiversity is also crucial, reflecting the importance of varied scholarly publications beyond traditional journal articles, such as monographs and edited collections. Additionally, non-traditional research outputs play a vital role in SSH. Dissemination of results and scholarly communication in SSH extends beyond academic circles, placing a strong emphasis on giving back to society. This involves engaging with a broader community and policymakers to ensure the societal impact and relevance of the research conducted within SSH.

### Managing Research Lifecycle in SSH

Open Access Books

The lifecycle paradigm can be adapted to specific activities of the research lifecycle to help visualise the steps of the process on how to best manage and produce outputs. One of the outputs that are very important to SSH researchers are monographs. [OAPEN has produced guidance](https://www.oabooks-toolkit.org/) on how to fully prepare, produce and share a book from writing the manuscript to making it reusable.

FAIR data in the Humanities

Lifecycle frameworks could be applied not only for a type of research output, but also in different domains. This example covers a FAIR data management lifecycle in the Humanities, pointing out the various necessities to considers depending on the stage of the lifecycle.
