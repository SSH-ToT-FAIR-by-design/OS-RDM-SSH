## Description

The first module of the training is an introduction of the Open Science environment to SSH researchers. This module has four learning outcomes.

- Describe the current policy landscape that shapes knowledge production and the way it affects the SSH Research Framework
- Identify SSH practices in Open Science
- Recognise SSH specificities within the research workflow during knowledge production from an ethical, legal and methodological perspective.
- Describe  what the research data management requirements and standards are

In this sub-module we will discuss:

- Open Science practices

- OS practices commonly adopted by the SSH

## Open Science Practices

We have identified some of the best-known OS practices, which include a set of principles and methods aimed at improving transparency, accessibility and collaboration in research. 
Pre-registration and pre-printing are highlighted as promoting transparency, reducing bias, rapid dissemination, access, feedback and visibility. 

The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles are well known for their focus on data management and ethical considerations. Bibliodiversity as a practice emphasises cultural and linguistic diversity and diverse publishing models. Data papers emphasise citation, discoverability and re-usability. 
Citizen science encourages public participation and engagement, fostering collaboration and innovation. Last but not least, multilingualism promotes inclusivity, cultural sensitivity and broader audience reach. 

### SSH Open Science Practices

Some of these practices aim to improve the quality and impact of research in the social sciences and humanities. Not all of these practices are currently used by SSH researchers. The FAIR and CARE principles are crucial for SSH and all disciplines. Bibliodiversity provides a platform for SSH researchers as it supports a diverse publication environment. And, of course, multilingualism is at the heart of citizen science and SSH research, given the local and regional context that these fields represent.
