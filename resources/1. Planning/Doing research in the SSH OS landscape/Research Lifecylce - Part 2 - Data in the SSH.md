## Description

The first module of the training is an introduction of the Open Science environment to SSH researchers. This module has four learning outcomes.

- Describe the current policy landscape that shapes knowledge production and the way it affects the SSH Research Framework
- Identify SSH practices in Open Science
- Recognise SSH specificities within the research workflow during knowledge production from an ethical, legal and methodological perspective.
- Describe  what the research data management requirements and standards are

In this learning unit we will discuss data with a particular focus on SSH:

- Data in the SSH
- Data in the Humanities
- Data in Social Sciences

## Data in the SSH

Data is a multidimensional concept that can be interpreted in several ways (Giglia, 2021a, 2021b):

First, data as a process: it is a dynamic output that is generated, processed, refined and used in an ongoing cycle that spans the entire research life cycle. This interpretation emphasises the continuous nature of data, highlighting its evolution and the transformative processes it undergoes.

Second, data as a record obtained through a method: in the social sciences and humanities (SSH), data represent information obtained through systematic observation, measurement, and experimental procedures, such as surveys, interviews, or ethnographic studies. This perspective emphasises the importance of methodological rigour in the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data.

Third, data as anything formalised through language: language acts as a 'data carrier', containing rich information about human history, culture and society. Language records also document the evolution of language, semantics and usage patterns over time, providing valuable insights into linguistic and cultural development.

Finally, data in the form of books, corpora and codices: these resources serve as repositories of information, providing structured and/or unstructured data that can be analysed for various purposes. This interpretation recognises the role of traditional and digital texts as important sources of knowledge and data for analysis. 

As such, we arrive at certain definitions, if that is possible:

**Humanities:**
> “We could then define data in the humanities broadly as all materials and assets scholars collect, generate, and use during all stages of the research cycle” (ALLEA Report, 2020 – Sustainable and FAIR data sharing in the humanities).

**Social Sciences:**
> In the social sciences, "data" refers to quantitative or qualitative information collected through observation, measurement, or inquiry that is used to understand, interpret, and analyze human behavior, social structures, and societal trends.

The word "data" evolves to become, perhaps, research material. Highlighting the challenges of interpreting what is data in the SSH reveals several key issues. **Subjectivity** plays an important role, as there is no clear definition of data, leading to different types of resources being interpreted as data. This ambiguity is compounded by **contextualisation**, where the definition of data depends on various factors, including the perspective of the researcher and the specific context of the study. In addition, the **multiplicity of data types and formats** adds to the complexity, as data in SSH can encompass a wide range of formats and types, making standardisation and consistent interpretation difficult.

### Data in the Humanities

In the descriptions below, when we refer to humanities, it is also inclusive of the digital humanities as a practice. First and foremost, Edmond (2020) identified associated data in the humanities with a taxonomy.
