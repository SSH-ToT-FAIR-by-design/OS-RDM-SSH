## Open Science Practices

We have identified some of the best-known OS practices, which include a set of principles and methods aimed at improving transparency, accessibility and collaboration in research. 
Pre-registration and pre-printing (Henderson, 2022) are highlighted as promoting transparency, reducing bias, rapid dissemination, access, feedback and visibility. 

The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles are well known for their focus on data management and ethical considerations (Carroll et al., 2020; Wilkinson et al., 2016). Bibliodiversity as a practice emphasises cultural and linguistic diversity and diverse publishing models (Giménez Toledo et al., 2019). Data papers emphasise citation, discoverability and re-usability. 

Citizen science encourages public participation and engagement, fostering collaboration and innovation (European Citizen Science Association, 2020). Last but not least, multilingualism promotes inclusivity, cultural sensitivity and broader audience reach (Helsinki Initiative on Multilingualism in Scholarly Communication, 2019). 

### SSH Open Science Practices

Some of these practices aim to improve the quality and impact of research in the social sciences and humanities. Not all of these practices are currently used by SSH researchers. The FAIR and CARE principles are crucial for SSH and all disciplines. Bibliodiversity provides a platform for SSH researchers as it supports a diverse publication environment. And, of course, multilingualism is at the heart of citizen science and SSH research, given the local and regional context that these fields represent.
