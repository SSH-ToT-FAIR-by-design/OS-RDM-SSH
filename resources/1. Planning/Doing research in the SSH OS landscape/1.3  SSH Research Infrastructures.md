## SSH Research Infrastructures

In the European Research Area, the SSH scientific community can rely on several Research Infrastructures (RI) dedicated to specific domains.

**SSHOC (Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud)** - [Go to page](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/)

The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud, initially a project and recently a consortium, offers several services. It is a discovery portal providing access to a wide range of research outputs and tools. It is also an aggregator of curated resources. The portal also includes a catalogue that provides contextual information about the resources listed. More generally, the SSHOC Marketplace, as a comprehensive list of SSH outputs, tools and data repositories, is the SSH entry point to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

**OPERAS (Open Scholarly Communication in the European Research Area for Social Sciences and Humanities)** - [Go to page](https://operas-eu.org/)

OPERAS is an RI dedicated to supporting open scholarly communication in the SSH at the European level. It aims to coordinate and promote the development of Open Access publishing models. The RI is developing a range of services to meet the open scholarly communication needs of the SSH community.

**CESSDA (Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives)** - [Go to page](https://www.cessda.eu/)

Focusing on the social sciences, CESSDA provides access to a wide range of data and tools. The RI was established to promote the acquisition, archiving and distribution of electronic data for the social sciences. In effect, the RI makes data available to a wider audience, including students, academics and policy makers. CESSDA also aims to facilitate research and education by providing guidelines and training specific to the social sciences.

**DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities, European Research Infrastructure Consortium)** - Go to page
	
DARIAH aims to support digital research and teaching in the arts and humanities. It provides researchers with access to digital tools, resources and methodologies. In addition to discovery services for accessing these types of resources, DARIAH also creates and manages training support and coordinates working groups on key humanities and arts themes.

**CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure)** - Go to page

CLARIN is an RI dedicated to linguistic resources. It provides access to digital language resources through its Virtual Language Observatory. The aim of the RI is to support the study of cultural and social phenomena in multilingual environments.

All these European SSH RIs share several common practices and objectives: 

- Focus on digital transformation and accessibility
- Supporting open science and open access
- Facilitating collaboration and networking
- Developing standards and best practices
- Provide training and educational resources
- Advocacy for policy development and innovation
- International and pan-European focus
