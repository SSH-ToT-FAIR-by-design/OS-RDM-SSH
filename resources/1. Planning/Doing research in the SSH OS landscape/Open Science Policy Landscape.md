## Description

The first module of the training is an introduction of the Open Science environment to SSH researchers. This module has four learning outcomes.

- Describe the current policy landscape that shapes knowledge production and the way it affects the SSH Research Framework
- Identify SSH practices in Open Science
- Recognise SSH specificities within the research workflow during knowledge production from an ethical, legal and methodological perspective.
- Describe  what the research data management requirements and standards are

In this sub-module we will discuss the current policy landscape through:

- Policies and Initiatives
- Funding
- Effects on knowledge production

## Open Science Policy Landscape

### Open Science - International Policy Landscape

<p align="justify">There are several initiatives approaching Open Science from different angles. In the context of this training material, the focus is primarily on EU-driven efforts, although we have identified some non-EU efforts as well. Policies provide incentives and guidance on what OS aims to achieve. Below is a list of the most relevant and well known, but of course the list is not exhaustive. As a trainer you are advised to look at your local, national and regional context to discuss specific policies with your audience.</p>

EU Initiatives and OS policies: 

- <p align="justify">[Horizon Europe OS Policy](https://rea.ec.europa.eu/open-science_en): Projects and research funded by Horizon Europe (and its associated programmes) should demonstrate OS practices alongside their research practices. The most common elements promoted by the Horizon OS policy are Open Access to scientific publications and the management of research data according to the FAIR principles. For example, all projects are required to produce a data management plan and demonstrate how they will manage their data and which data they plan to make open.</p>
    
- <p align="justify">European Council of the European Union: The EU Council produced two conclusions that are highly pertinent to the Open Science movement. The Council Conclusion on High-Quality, Open, Trustworthy and Equitable Scholarly Publishing and the Council Conclusion on Research Assessment and the Implementation of Open Science. Both have clear recommendations on how an organisation could enable and why the should prioritise open science practices.</p>
    
- <p align="justify">[Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/why-plan-s/): Plan S, championed by cOAlition S, is an initiative to ensure that scientific publications funded by public grants are made fully and immediately open access. The plan aims to eliminate publication paywalls, enabling universal access to research findings. This is vital for the progress and integrity of science, as open access facilitates the scrutiny, replication, and building upon of research. Plan S mandates that from 2021, all scholarly publications resulting from publicly funded research must be available in compliant open access journals or platforms.

- <p align="justify">[Helsinki Initiative](https://www.helsinki-initiative.org/): The Helsinki Initiative on Multilingualism in Scholarly Communication champions the use of multiple languages in academic research to enhance societal impact and knowledge exchange. Launched by the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies and partners, it seeks to protect national research infrastructures, support locally relevant studies, and promote language diversity in research assessment. The initiative urges policymakers, institutions, and funders to ensure equitable access to knowledge in various languages and to value high-quality research regardless of publication language.</p>

    
- <p align="justify">[Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA)](https://coara.eu/): The Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) is an international initiative focused on reforming the evaluation of research, researchers, and research organisations. CoARA promotes a framework that recognises diverse outputs, practices, and activities, prioritising qualitative judgement and responsible use of quantitative indicators. The initiative is based on ten commitments outlined in the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment, which aims to enhance the quality and impact of research by fostering a more inclusive and comprehensive assessment system.</p>
