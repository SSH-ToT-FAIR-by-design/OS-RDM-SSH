## Description

The first module of the training is an introduction of the Open Science environment to SSH researchers. This module has four learning outcomes.

- Describe the current policy landscape that shapes knowledge production and the way it affects the SSH Research Framework
- Identify SSH practices in Open Science
- Recognise SSH specificities within the research workflow during knowledge production from an ethical, legal and methodological perspective.
- Describe  what the research data management requirements and standards are

In this sub-module we will discuss the current policy landscape through:

- Policies and Initiatives
- Funding
- Effects on knowledge production

## Open Science Policy Landscape

### Open Science - International Policy Landscape

<p align="justify">There are several initiatives approaching Open Science from different angles. In the context of this training material, the focus is primarily on EU-driven efforts, although we have identified some non-EU efforts as well. Policies provide incentives and guidance on what OS aims to achieve. Below is a list of the most relevant and well known, but of course the list is not exhaustive. As a trainer you are advised to look at your local, national and regional context to discuss specific policies with your audience.</p>

EU Initiatives and OS policies: 

- <p align="justify">Horizon Europe OS Policy: Projects and research funded by Horizon Europe (and its associated programmes) should demonstrate OS practices alongside their research practices. The most common elements promoted by the Horizon OS policy are Open Access to scientific publications and the management of research data according to the FAIR principles. For example, all projects are required to produce a data management plan and demonstrate how they will manage their data and which data they plan to make open.</p>
    
- <p align="justify">European Council of the European Union: The EU Council produced two conclusions that are highly pertinent to the Open Science movement. The Council Conclusion on High-Quality, Open, Trustworthy and Equitable Scholarly Publishing and the Council Conclusion on Research Assessment and the Implementation of Open Science. Both have clear recommendations on how an organisation could enable and why the should prioritise open science practices.</p>

- Helsinki Initiative 
    
- Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA)
    

International OS Policies
