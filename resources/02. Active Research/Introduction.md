# Doing research in the SSH OS Landscape

### Description

The second module focuses on what we call active research. It presents elements that correspond to different stages of the research: data collection, data processing, preservation and documentation.Â  In this section, RDM and more technical aspects related to the FAIR Principles are detailed. 
## Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes from the provided Module 2 presentation on 'Active research: process, collect, store and document data' are as follows

1. Identify different types of metadata: Understand the different forms and functions of metadata.
2. Identify open file formats: Recognise and use file formats that are open and widely available.
3. Storing Data: Learn best practices for storing data securely and efficiently.
4. Managing sensitive data: Properly manage sensitive data to ensure privacy and compliance.
5. Apply open licences and data usage rights: Understand and apply open licences to data to facilitate sharing and reuse.
6. Document data: Effectively describe data and methods to ensure clarity, reproducibility and understanding by others.

These objectives aim to equip learners with the essential skills and knowledge to manage research data effectively within the OS (Open Science) landscape in the SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities).
