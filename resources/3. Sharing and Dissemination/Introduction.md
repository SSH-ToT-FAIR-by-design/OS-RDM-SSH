# Doing research in the SSH OS Landscape

### Description

The third module focuses on the evaluation of the research outcomes and their posterior preservation and dissemination. The module also tackles access and reuse of research outcomes. This item is actually part of the first step of the research lifecycle. It represents the beginning of a new cycle that draws from research outcomes properly preserved and disseminated. The learning outcomes of this module are listed below.

- Assess the FAIRness of data and other research outputs
- Draft a strategy for publishing research outputs
- Link data and publication
- Implement FAIR compliance strategies for monographs (how do you link data to the monograph)
- Adopt OS-compliant publication practices (e.g., standard metadata, stable text formats, persistent identifiers, open licensing).
- Identify(Find) and reuse existing data, codes, publications and any other kind of research outcome

## Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes from the provided Module 2 presentation on 'Active research: process, collect, store and document data' are as follows

1. Identify different types of metadata: Understand the different forms and functions of metadata.
2. Identify open file formats: Recognise and use file formats that are open and widely available.
3. Storing Data: Learn best practices for storing data securely and efficiently.
4. Managing sensitive data: Properly manage sensitive data to ensure privacy and compliance.
5. Apply open licences and data usage rights: Understand and apply open licences to data to facilitate sharing and reuse.
6. Document data: Effectively describe data and methods to ensure clarity, reproducibility and understanding by others.

These objectives aim to equip learners with the essential skills and knowledge to manage research data effectively within the OS (Open Science) landscape in the SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities).
