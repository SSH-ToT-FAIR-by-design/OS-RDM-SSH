## Description

The third module focuses on the evaluation of the research outcomes and their posterior preservation and dissemination. The module also tackles access and reuse of research outcomes. This item is actually part of the first step of the research lifecycle. It represents the beginning of a new cycle that draws from research outcomes properly preserved and disseminated. Learning outcomes include: 

- Design an Open Science publishing strategy for the dissemination of research results
- Identify and reuse existing data codes, publications and any other type of research output
- Link data to publications
- Implement FAIR-compliant strategies for monographs
- Assess the FAIRness of data and other research outputs

In this learning unit we will discuss concepts associated with data publishing:

- Data Publication Checklist
- Data Repositories
- Data Citation
- Data Availability Statements
- Data & Monographs

### Data publishing: linking data to publications

Linking publications to data promotes transparency, reproducibility and collaboration across disciplines. When researchers make their datasets and other output formats ([see the module on data in SSH](https://ssh-tot-fair-by-design.github.io/OS-RDM-SSH/latest/1.%20Planning/Doing%20research%20in%20the%20SSH%20OS%20landscape/1.5%20Research%20Lifecycle%20-%20Data%20in%20the%20SSH/#data-in-the-ssh)) available, they enable the scientific community to verify results, replicate studies and build on existing work. 

To maximise the impact of linking publications to data, it is essential to adhere to standardised data formats and metadata conventions to ensure that data are both discoverable and interpretable. This requires collaboration between researchers, publishers and funders to establish and enforce best practices for data sharing.

As a helpful measure, here is a publication checklist to always keep in mind (Table produced from Stockholm University: [Publish Research Data]( https://www.su.se/staff/researchers/research-data/preserve-research-information/publish-research-data-1.598234)):

| Checklist                                                                                                                                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Select filenames that indicate the contents and are understandable&nbsp;                                                                      |
| 2. Store files in common -and ideally- open formats. Describe file formats and indicate relevant software&nbsp;&nbsp;                            |
| 3. Consider providing additional documentation on variables applied                                                                              |
| 4. &nbsp;Link data and metadata to standardized vocabularies standards ontologies&nbsp;&nbsp;                                                    |
| 5. Provide complete reference records including PIDs&nbsp;&nbsp;                                                                                 |
| 6. Link the deposited resource to authors institutions and other entities involved in or supporting the research project. Use PIDs (i.e. ORCIDs) |

### Data Citation

Researchers should provide citations for datasets. This involves creating a formal citation with information about the dataset authors, title, year of publication, version and PID.

#### Data Citation Principles

The 8 citation principles as defined in the [Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles](https://force11.org/info/joint-declaration-of-data-citation-principles-final/) are:

- **Importance**: Data should be regarded as legitimate, citable products of research. Data citations should be accorded the same importance in the scholarly record as citations of other research objects.
- **Credit and attribution**: Data citations should facilitate the provision of scholarly credit and normative and legal attribution to all contributors to the data.
- **Evidence**: Whenever and wherever a claim is based on data, the corresponding data should be cited.
- **Unique identification**: A data citation should include a persistent method of identification that is machine-processable, globally unique, and widely used by a community.
- **Access**: Data citations should facilitate access to the data itself and to associated metadata, documentation, code, and other materials necessary for humans and machines to make informed use of the referenced data.
- **Persistence**: Unique identifiers and metadata describing the data and their disposition should persist, even beyond the lifetime of the data they describe.
- **Specificity and Verifiability**: Data citations should facilitate identification of, access to, and verification of the specific data that support a claim. Citations or citation metadata should include information about provenance and fixity.
- **Interoperability and flexibility**: Data citation methods should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the different practices of different communities, but should not differ so much as to compromise the interoperability of data citation practices.

#### Data Citation - Example

[Dataverse.org provides an example](Source:https://dataverse.org/best-practices/data-citation) and a breakdwon of how the principles are exemplified through a proper citation practice.

#### Data Availability Statement

What is a data availability statement? It is a section in a published resource where authors provide information about the accessibility of the data that accompany the publication. 

By including a data availability statement, researchers not only improve the quality and reliability of their work, but also contribute to a more open, reproducible and impactful scientific enterprise.

##### Benefits

So what are the benefits for providing a data availability statement? 

- Promotes transparency and helps researchers understand the published findings and verify the results.
- Facilitates reproducibility and allows researchers to replicate the study
- Enhances discoverability and allows researchers to access and reuse the data
- Encourages ethical practices and compliance to relevant standards  
- Increases impact, as data become easily findable and citable

However, it is essential that data are properly prepared before publication. Researchers need to ensure that their datasets are managed in a way that maximises their utility and impact. This includes assigning unique identifiers to datasets to improve discoverability, storing data in accessible repositories with clear licences for use, and adhering to standardised formats and metadata conventions to facilitate compatibility and integration between different systems.

### Linking monographs and data

Data are the foundation of empirical research and theoretical argumentation. At SSH, data-whether quantitative or qualitative-provide the essential evidence needed to understand and analyze complex social phenomena. Quantitative data, derived from surveys, experiments, and administrative records, allow researchers to identify patterns and test hypotheses. Qualitative data, such as interviews, multimedia resources, and textual resources, provide contextual insights.

In the social sciences and humanities, monographs are the primary form of scholarly output because they allow for extensive examination of primary sources, the development of sophisticated arguments, and the presentation of a coherent thesis, often shaped by data analysis and interpretation. Thus, research data are part of the output and the published version, which is not necessarily the case in other disciplines where data are deposited/published as supplementary materials, datasets, etc.

Therefore, linking data to monographs increases the transparency, credibility, and impact of scholarly work.

- The case of Open Book Publishers as an example of a comprehensive data publication policy.

**Examples**: 

Authors store the resources in their repository, where possible, as a further backup. If the data is hosted online as an additional resource, OPB links to the online resources in the book, usually as part of the table of contents.

Even if the dataset is hosted elsewhere, OBP prefers that a copy of it is also hosted on the book's website, as this keeps all the key resources together on the book's landing page (which is also where the book's DOI points to).

- [Image, Knife and Gluepot](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/obp.0145), by Kate Rudy : The book includes an appendix, presented as a digital resource and  hosted on OBP’s website. It is a spreadsheet of data about where all  of the pieces of a dismantled manuscript are kept (the author had spent many  years tracking them down in various archives and the manuscript, its  dismantling and its afterlives is the subject of the book).

- [Health Care in the Information Society](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/obp.0384) by David Ingram also has a large number of appendices relating to legal  and policy changes in health provision in the UK that are hosted on our  website.

- [William Moorcroft, Potter: Individuality by Design](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/obp.0349)  by Jonathan Mallinson has online image portfolios and unpublished documents hosted on our website.

- [A Lexicon of Medieval Nordic Law](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/OBP.0188)  by  Inger Larsson, Ulrika Djärv, Jeffrey Love, Christine Peel, and Erik  Simensen, is a suite of printed and other digital editions of this  website, drawing the content directly from the online database.
