## Description

The second module focuses on what we call active research. It presents elements that correspond to different stages of the research: data collection, data processing, preservation and documentation.  In this section, RDM and more technical aspects related to the FAIR Principles are detailed. The learning outcomes are the following:

1. Identify different types of metadata
2. Identify open file formats
3. Storing Data
4. Managing sensitive data
5. Apply open licences and data usage rights
6. Document data

In this learning unit we will discuss licences:

- Creative Commons: widely used on texts and data
  
- Open Source licences: licences assigned to pieces of code, script or software

### Licencing

This specific learning unit on licensing should be used in conjunction with the material from the FAIR-by-Design Training of Trainers. In particular, we would like you to go through the [Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%201%20%E2%80%93%20Prepare/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/#intellectual-property-rights-ipr) learning unit, which includes discussions on [copyright](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%201%20%E2%80%93%20Prepare/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/#copyright), [licensing](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%201%20%E2%80%93%20Prepare/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/#licensing) and [attribution and citation](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%201%20%E2%80%93%20Prepare/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/#attribution-and-citing). This will give you a more complete perspective on the licensing discussion. Our unit is primarily an introduction to the types of licences that exist, focusing on Creative Commons and Open Source. 

Licensing is a critical component when deciding to share your research, providing a legal framework that defines how data can be used by others. There are several types of licenses that you may encounter or use in your research. Our focus today is to introduce to Creative Commons licence which are widely used in different contexts, and Open Source Licences given the increasing popularity and relevance of open source software in the context of Open Science.

#### Creative Commons licences

Creative Commons (CC) licences are widely used for text, images and data. They allow authors to grant permission to use their work under certain conditions, ranging from allowing any kind of reuse with attribution to allowing only non-commercial use. Understanding the different types of CC licences (e.g. CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC) will help you choose the right one for your work.

The table below describes the various aspects one can implement using Creative Commons.

Another interesting depiction of the licences is the spectrum of openness that we can have:

##### Which licence is more relevant to your work?

When choosing a licence for your work, consider the nature of the output:

- **Publishing a monograph**: For text-based works such as monographs, Creative Commons licences are usually appropriate. They allow you to specify the conditions under which others can use your work, such as requiring attribution or restricting commercial use.

- **Journal articles**: Similar to monographs, journal articles often benefit from Creative Commons licences, which ensure wide dissemination while protecting your rights as an author.

- **Data/Research Material**: When sharing research data, a Creative Commons licence can clarify how others can use your data. Alternatively, specific data sharing licences may be more appropriate, depending on the field and sensitivity of the data.
### Open Source licences

Open source licences apply to software and code. They allow software to be used, modified and distributed freely. Popular open source licences include the GNU General Public License (GPL), the MIT License and the Apache License. Each of these licences has specific terms and conditions that must be understood to ensure compliance.

**Types of access:

- Open data - fully anonymised and no personal data identifiable
- Restricted - still anonymised data
- Closed data - sensitive data that cannot be properly curated.

Each option always depends on the specific research activity, the type of data we are working with and the composition of the project team, whether it is based in the same institution, in different institutions but in the same country, or if we then start to consider further regional aspects such as sharing data outside the EU and third countries. Different laws apply and specifics need to be carefully negotiated.

Finally, it is important to include security measures such as password protection and encryption in your data management strategy for sensitive data: 

Password protection and encryption offer significant benefits in securing sensitive data. They prevent unauthorised access by ensuring that only those with the correct credentials can view or modify the data. Encryption converts data into an unreadable format that can only be deciphered with the correct decryption key. This layered protection helps maintain the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information, providing a robust defence against data breaches and cyber threats.

### Anonymisation

Stam and Diaz (2020) assert that anonymisation can bypass data protection laws since anonymised data lacks personal information. However, achieving full anonymisation is challenging, particularly for qualitative data that focus on specific contexts. When dealing with materials like interview transcripts, it’s safer to assume that personal data is being processed, necessitating compliance with data protection laws. Participants must be fully informed about the handling and third-party disclosure of their data. 

As a summary of the steps towards anonymisation, we would like to point out the following ones from the [UK Data Service guidance](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/anonymisation/anonymisation-step-by-step/): 

- Remove direct identifiers
- Aggregation
- Generalisation 
- Restrict the upper or lower rangers
- Anonymise geo-referenced data
- Anonymise relational data

Each category carries its own methodology and it is important to understand which and how to implement the various anonymisation steps. We would also like to point you towards the Information Commissioner's Officer (ICO) guidance on effective anonymisation: [Chapter 2: how do we ensure anonymisation is effective?](Chapter 2: How do we ensure anonymisation is effective?)

Chapter 2 of the ICO's draft guidance on anonymisation highlights the importance of effective anonymisation to reduce the risk of identifiability to a sufficiently low level. It emphasises that identifiability extends beyond names to any data that can distinguish individuals. The guidance stresses that achieving effective anonymisation requires a thorough understanding of data protection laws and techniques to mitigate the risk of re-identification. It also emphasises the need for continuous assessment and adaptation of anonymisation methods as part of a broader data protection strategy.

### Tools

In the final part of this unit, we would like to point some tools that could help with the anonymisation and sharing data process:

- [AMNESIA](https://amnesia.openaire.eu/) 
- [Tools recommended by UK Data Service](https://data-archive.ac.uk/managing-data/digital-curation-and-data-publishing/tools-we-use/)
	- Text anonymisation helper tool 
	- AxCrypt (commercial) – Encryption
- [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) 
- [Zendto](https://zend.to/) 

We would like to highlight two of the tools mentioned here: 

**AMNESIA** is a tool developed by OpenAIRE: key features of the tool are: 

- Pseudonymisation
- Masking
- K-Anonymity
- Demographic Statistics

You can see further details about the tool, [here](https://amnesia.openaire.eu/). 

**Zendto** is a tool that supports filesharing. Key aspects of the tool are: 

•Secure encryption & decryption
•Customisable and translation to 14 languages
•Open Source & Free
•Aligns with GDPR
•Large file transfer

ZendTo is an open source file transfer and sharing solution designed to send and receive large files easily and securely. It's useful for organisations looking for a secure, private alternative to commercial file sharing services. 

Feel free to explore the tool [here](https://zend.to/).
