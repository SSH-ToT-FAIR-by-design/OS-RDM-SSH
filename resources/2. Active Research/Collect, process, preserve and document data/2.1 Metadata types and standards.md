## Description

The second module focuses on what we call active research. It presents elements that correspond to different stages of the research: data collection, data processing, preservation and documentation.  In this section, RDM and more technical aspects related to the FAIR Principles are detailed. The learning outcomes are the following:

1. Identify different types of metadata
2. Identify open file formats
3. Storing Data
4. Managing sensitive data
5. Apply open licences and data usage rights
6. Document data

In this learning unit we will discuss:

- Types of metadata
- Metadata Standards

### Metadata

Simply put, metadata is data about data. However, its role in scholarly communication is far more profound. Borgman (2015) states, "Data will remain 'dark matter' in scholarly communication unless it is described, curated, and made discoverable." This highlights the critical need for metadata to make research data accessible and useful.

Metadata performs multiple functions: it describes, organises and enables the discovery of data, ensuring that data does not remain obscure and under-utilised. Its importance in research cannot be overstated, as it increases the transparency, reproducibility and long-term usability of data.

To understand the full scope of metadata's functions, importance and relevance to research, we will explore different types of metadata and the standards that govern them. By understanding these elements, researchers can effectively manage their data, making it a valuable asset in the academic and scientific community.

### Metadata types

### Types of metadata

Metadata can be broadly categorised into three types: Administrative, Descriptive and Structural. Each type serves a different purpose in the effective management and use of data.

1. **Administrative Metadata**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages a resource.
   - **Components**: Contains information about the creation, acquisition and use of data.
   - **Examples**: File type, creation date, access rights and preservation metadata. This type of metadata ensures the proper management and long-term accessibility of data.

2. **Descriptive metadata:
   - **Purpose**: Describes a resource.
   - **Components**: Provides information to help identify and discover a resource.
   - **Examples**: Title, author, abstract, keywords and subject classifications. Descriptive metadata is critical to search and retrieval processes, making data discoverable and understandable.

3. **Structural metadata:
   - **Purpose**: Indicates the provenance of a resource.
   - **Components**: Shows how different components of a resource are organised.
   - **Examples**: Tables of contents, page numbers, chapters, sections, and relationships between records. Structural metadata ensures that data is organised logically and that relationships are clear.

Understanding these types of metadata is essential for effective data management, ensuring that data is accurately described, easily discoverable, and properly organised for future use.

### Pillars  
  

To enhance our definition of Open Science, it is beneficial to examine the foundational pillars of Open Science as detailed in the advisory paper '[Open Science and its role in universities: a roadmap for cultural change,' published by the League of European Research Universities](https://www.leru.org/publications/open-science-and-its-role-in-universities-a-roadmap-for-cultural-change) (LERU). This document offers critical insights into the integral components that support the Open Science framework.

In this roadmap, the authors outline 8 dimensions:

-   The future of Scholarly publishing
    
-   FAIR Data
    
-   The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)
    
-   Education and skills
    
-   Rewards and incentives
    
-   Next-generation metrics
    
-   Research Integrity
    
-   Citizen Science
    

These various dimensions underscore the transformative impact of the Open Science movement on research culture and highlight its ambition to foster engagement with societal stakeholders.

In the initial section, we've outlined a working definition of Open Science to establish a shared baseline for comprehension of this crucial concept. As future trainers, you'll have the flexibility to tailor this definition to better suit the specific needs and backgrounds of your prospective audiences.
