## Description

The second module focuses on what we call active research. It presents elements that correspond to different stages of the research: data collection, data processing, preservation and documentation.  In this section, RDM and more technical aspects related to the FAIR Principles are detailed. The learning outcomes are the following:

1. Identify different types of metadata
2. Identify open file formats
3. Storing Data
4. Managing sensitive data
5. Apply open licences and data usage rights
6. Document data

In this learning unit we will discuss:

- Types of metadata
- Metadata Standards

### Metadata

Simply put, metadata is data about data. However, its role in scholarly communication is far more profound. Borgman (2015) states, "Data will remain 'dark matter' in scholarly communication unless it is described, curated, and made discoverable." This highlights the critical need for metadata to make research data accessible and useful.

Metadata performs multiple functions: it describes, organises and enables the discovery of data, ensuring that data does not remain obscure and under-utilised. Its importance in research cannot be overstated, as it increases the transparency, reproducibility and long-term usability of data.

To understand the full scope of metadata's functions, importance and relevance to research, we will explore different types of metadata and the standards that govern them. By understanding these elements, researchers can effectively manage their data, making it a valuable asset in the academic and scientific community.

### Types of metadata

Metadata can be broadly categorised into three types: Administrative, Descriptive and Structural. Each type serves a different purpose in the effective management and use of data.

**Administrative Metadata**:

- **Purpose**: Manages a resource.
- **Components**: Contains information about the creation, acquisition and use of data.
- **Examples**: File type, creation date, access rights and preservation metadata. This type of metadata ensures the proper management and long-term accessibility of data.

**Descriptive metadata**:

- **Purpose**: Describes a resource.
- **Components**: Provides information to help identify and discover a resource.
- **Examples**: Title, author, abstract, keywords and subject classifications. Descriptive metadata is critical to search and retrieval processes, making data discoverable and understandable.

**Structural metadata**:

- **Purpose**: Indicates the provenance of a resource.
- **Components**: Shows how different components of a resource are organised.
- **Examples**: Tables of contents, page numbers, chapters, sections, and relationships between records. Structural metadata ensures that data is organised logically and that relationships are clear.

Understanding these types of metadata is essential for effective data management, ensuring that data is accurately described, easily discoverable, and properly organised for future use.
### Metadata Standards

Deutz et al. (2020), in the [howtofair.dk ](https://howtofair.dk/how-to-fair/metadata/#metadata-standards-and-ontologies) webpage, provide an explanation on what is a metadata standard: 

> A metadata standard is a subject-specific guide to your metadata. Metadata elements are grouped into sets designed for a specific purpose and given a standard name and definition. Rules on what content must be included, what syntax must be used, or a controlled vocabulary can also be included in a metadata standard.

Focusing on SSH, there are several standards which could be useful to researchers according always to the type of research.  You can explore the full list of metadata standards in the [RDA Metadata Standards Catalog](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/). Another fun and interesting depiction of the multiplicity of metadata, is the work produced by Jenn Riley, [Seeing Standards: A Visualization of the Metadata Universe](https://jennriley.com/metadatamap/)

### Metadata Transcription Template  
  
The Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) with the contribution of University of Amsterdam produced a [Metadata transcription template](https://dans.knaw.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/UvA_DANS_Template_Interview_metadatatranscript-EN.docx). The template provides useful information about the context and process of the interview. Besides the most well-known descriptive metadata fields, such as title and subtitle, we would like to emphasise for example the following metadata fields: 

- Recording by: Name and type of recording (audio/video), naming device
	- **Note: The name of the device can enable others who wish to conduct interviews to use similar technology. It is also essential for replication if one wishes to test the functions and capabilities of the device as reported in a research report**.
	
- Setting: Describe the setting and atmosphere of the interview to illustrate what cannot be sensed by simply reading the text in the transcript.
	- **Note: This section of the template is used, for example, to provide contextual information about a situation that could add qualitative elements, for example if interviews take place in situations where refugees are involved, or for some reason there is stress or reasons that influence aspects of the interview.**
